						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned from this article that accessibility in design is a very real thing. 
								The fact that the WHO "estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment" is very eye-opening. 
								It was also surprising to see that over 800 federal lawsuits were filed over design accessibility, since normally you wouldn't think a website design could affect so much. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Like last week's article, my favorite part of this article was the resources it linked.
								Specifically, I thought the Colorable and Colorsafe tools were pretty useful. 
								I also like how it touched upon color accessibility being an ethical matter, not just for superficial design reasons. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>  In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment. 
								That statistic alone is reason enough to design for accessibility.</p>
