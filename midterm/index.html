				<h1>THIS IS OUR STORY.</h1>
				<p>
					Top Dog grew out of a boy’s love of sausage, a staple in his German immigrants’ New York home over the WWII years. His paper route to a well-mixed neighborhood assured that Italian, Polish, even Hungarian sausages were soon no strangers to that developing appetite and palate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then lotsa late nights on the town in San Francisco in the sixties.. sampling around for the best frankfurter to sell (and eat!) led to other fine sausages and the idea was born to offer them as hot dogs as well. When no right site could be found in S.F. or Sausalito, hello, Berkeley. That was 1966 and with the paint hardly dry we opened on —surprise— a home football game day. Fifteen minutes later it was full house madness. Talk about learning to host and cook on the run!
				</p>
				<p>
					With such fans it's been interesting, often challenging — but fun. As in that boy's world, largely gone by, we continue to seek out the best sausage from the best sausage-makers who, born to a tradition of taste, we believe, tend to serve it better. 
				</p>
                <p>
					We remain evermore on the prrrowl for unique sausages for affordable and convenient hot dog enjoyment.
